Find device id of AC Line 3

### ASSISTANT
I'd be happy to help you find the device ID for AC Line 3, but I don't have access to your specific system or network information. To find the device ID, you could try these approaches:

## Common Methods:

1. **System Configuration Interface**
   - Access your building management system (BMS)
   - Navigate to the electrical or HVAC section
   - Look for AC Line 3 in the device list

2. **Network Scanning Tools**
   - Use tools like `nmap` to scan your network
   - Look for devices with names containing "AC" or "Line 3"

3. **Physical Device Check**
   - Check the physical unit for a label or nameplate
   - Look for MAC address, serial number, or device ID

4. **Documentation Review**
   - Check system installation manuals
   - Review network device inventory
   - Look at electrical panel schedules

Could you provide more context about:
- What type of system you're working with?
- Is this for a smart building, industrial control system, or home automation?
- What format does the device ID typically take in your system?

This would help me give you more specific guidance.

### USER
I’ve activated pfn-sse tools. Use that

### ASSISTANT
I searched for devices matching 'AC Line 3' but no devices were found [1]. 

This could mean:
- The device name might be different (e.g., "AC_Line_3", "Air Conditioning Line 3", or "ACL3")
- The device might not be currently connected or online
- It might be registered under a different naming convention

Could you provide:
- Any alternative names this device might be known by?
- The exact system or network you're searching within?
- Any partial device names or IDs you might remember?

I can search again with different terms once you provide more details.

### USER
Try AHU Line 3

### ASSISTANT
Based on the search results, I found **AHU Line 3** which might be what you're looking for [1].

**Device Details:**
- **Name:** AHU Line 3
- **Device ID:** 140
- **Type:** Power Meter
- **Code:** AHU-03

AHU (Air Handling Unit) Line 3 could be the AC Line 3 you were searching for, as AHUs are commonly part of air conditioning systems. The device ID you're looking for would be **140**.

Is this the device you were trying to locate?

### USER
What are the current for this device for the last hour?

### ASSISTANT
Based on the telemetry data for AHU Line 3, there is no current data available for the last hour (2026-01-09 06:58 to 2026-01-09 07:58 WIB) [1].

The system shows "No data available for this period" for the 100ms Current A measurement [1]. As suggested in the results, you might want to try using `get_device_data_range` to check data availability for different time periods or to see if there's data available for other time ranges [1].

This could indicate:
- The device may be offline or not transmitting data
- There might be a communication issue with the device
- The data collection might be temporarily interrupted

Would you like me to help you check data availability for a different time range?

### USER
What about voltage in the same period of time?

### ASSISTANT
Based on the telemetry data for AHU Line 3, here are the voltage readings for the last hour (2026-01-09 06:58 to 2026-01-09 07:58 WIB) [1]:

**Voltage A-B Summary:**
- **Average**: 404.96V
- **Minimum**: 401.62V 
- **Maximum**: 407.28V

**Sample Data Points:**
- 06:59: 406.78V
- 07:00: 406.99V
- 07:01: 405.93V
- 07:56: 407.01V
- 07:57: 406.64V
- 07:58: 406.40V

The voltage appears to be stable throughout the hour, staying within a relatively narrow range of about 5.66V (407.28V - 401.62V) [1]. The data shows 60 measurement points with 5-second intervals, indicating consistent voltage supply to AHU Line 3 during this period [1].

### USER
Check average voltage line to neutral

### ASSISTANT
Based on the available quantities for AHU Line 3, I can see that the device has "100ms Voltage L-N Avg (ID: 3332)" which is the average voltage line to neutral measurement [1]. However, to get the actual voltage values, I would need to retrieve the telemetry data for this specific quantity.

Would you like me to get the current readings for the average line-to-neutral voltage (quantity ID: 3332) for a specific time period?

### USER
Yes, for the last hour

### ASSISTANT
Based on the telemetry data for AHU Line 3, here are the average voltage line-to-neutral readings for the last hour (2026-01-09 07:00 to 2026-01-09 08:00 WIB) [1]:

**Voltage L-N Average Summary:**
- **Average**: 234.66V
- **Minimum**: 232.79V 
- **Maximum**: 236.00V

**Sample Data Points:**
- 07:01: 235.31V
- 07:02: 235.57V
- 07:03: 235.71V
- 07:57: 235.60V
- 07:58: 235.48V
- 07:59: 235.55V

The line-to-neutral voltage shows excellent stability throughout the hour, with only a 3.21V variation range (236.00V - 232.79V) [1]. The data includes 59 measurement points with 5-second intervals, indicating consistent voltage supply to AHU Line 3 during this period [1]
